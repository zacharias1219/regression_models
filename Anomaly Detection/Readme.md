Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in various businesses, especially those dealing with financial transactions, online activities, and security-sensitive operations.

We can follow a systematic process to address the challenge of anomaly detection. We can begin by collecting and preparing transaction data, ensuring its accuracy and consistency.
Then, we can find patterns in the data to find anomalies and use specialized anomaly detection algorithms like isolation forest to detect anomalies.
